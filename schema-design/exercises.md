# Practice Scenarios – Schema Design

Here are practice scenarios to apply your understanding of schema design and table relationships:

1. **List All Users**  
   Retrieve all users along with their names and email addresses.

2. **List All Products**  
   Display all products including name, price, and category.

3. **Filter Products by Category**  
   Get all products that belong to the "Furniture" category.

4. **User Order Lookup**  
   Find all orders placed by the user named "Ahmed".

5. **Product Count per Category**  
   Show how many products exist in each product category.

6. **Orders with Items and Quantity**  
   For every order, list its associated items and their quantities.

7. **Top Spending Users**  
   Identify the users who have spent the most on orders.

8. **Users without Orders**  
   Retrieve users who haven’t placed any orders.

9. **Most Popular Product**  
   Determine which product has been ordered the most based on total quantity.

10. **Average Order Value**  
   Calculate the average value of each order placed.

> Try writing the SQL queries for these scenarios in `queries.sql` and validate them using your sample seed data.
